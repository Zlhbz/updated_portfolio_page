# updated_portfolio_page

Updated Portfolio Page

Objective
This implementation is developed and extended version of the Portfolio page I did before.

Purpose
Creating a well designed and intuitive to use website in order to show the short cv and projects.

Technologies
-Materialize HTML/CSS
-JQuery
-Materialize Icons
-Font Awesome Icons

Process
I started to do the homework by downloading Materialize starter template. I kept continue to add features I want through materialize. I also added some fetaures like social media accounts that doesnt exist in the previous version of the portfolio 

Goal
-I feel like I do not have design intuition. After I watched several videos, I was able to match colors and etc. I still don't know if my portfolio is user friendly. I need to spend time on studying design of the website

-The images in the cards are not images of my projects. I wanted to put screenshots of the projects but I couldn't adjust sizes of screenshots to fit the same way for all. Next time I will change them.
